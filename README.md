## Linking!

An inline link occurs within the text body, and is a really quick way of creating a link in your Markdown file. To do an inline link, you wrap the text you want to use as the link in square brackets [], and then put the link in normal brackets ():

[GOOGLE IT!](http://www.google.com)


_These are like inpage nav elements of a website_

Here's a link to [_Google_][google-link]  
And one to *[GitHub][github-link]*  
*Links are at stored at the bottom how cool*  
_They are stylable too oooh_

My favourite food:  
![egg](https://qa-courseware-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/markdown/links_images/000.jpeg)

the bracketed bit is the alt text.

![Manchester City][blue]
![Manchester United][red]

easy way to make your markdown abit more readable, like setting variables!
